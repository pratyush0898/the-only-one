# Code of Conduct

This project is built for learning, sharing, and creating. We want contributors and visitors to feel welcome and respected. This Code of Conduct outlines expected behavior and steps for reporting unacceptable behavior.

## Our standards

Be respectful. Assume people are doing their best. Focus on ideas and work, not on personal attributes. Harassment, hateful language, threats, and discrimination are not allowed.

Be constructive. When giving feedback, explain what is wrong and suggest a concrete improvement. Keep tone curious, not confrontational.

Be empathetic. People come from different backgrounds and levels of experience. Help where you can and ask for help when you need it.

## Expected behavior

* Use inclusive, professional language.
* Give clear, actionable feedback on code and documentation.
* Respect others time by keeping issues and PRs focused and well described.
* Attribute and cite third party code and assets appropriately.

## Unacceptable behavior

* Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments.
* Harassment, stalking, or threats of violence.
* Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or other discriminatory language.
* Posting private information without consent.
* Persistently derailing conversations or ignoring maintainer requests.

## Contributor and maintainer responsibilities

### Contributors

* Follow the project style and guidelines when submitting changes.
* Be open to feedback and iterate on your work.
* If someone asks you to stop a behavior that is harming the community, stop and reflect.

### Maintainers

* Maintain a respectful tone in reviews and responses.
* Make decisions transparently and explain the reasoning for rejections or requests for change.
* Enforce this Code of Conduct consistently.

## Reporting and enforcement

If you experience or witness a violation, please report it by opening an issue marked Private or emailing the repository owner. Include:

* A short description of the incident.
* Where and when it happened, with links or screenshots if available.
* Names of people involved, if known.

Reports will be handled confidentially. Maintainers may take steps including a private warning, temporary blocking, or removal from the project depending on the severity of the behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces related to the project including the repository, issue tracker, pull requests, associated chat channels, and events organized by the project.

## A note on forgiveness and growth

People make mistakes. When appropriate, we prefer education and correction over punishment. However, repeated or severe violations will be addressed firmly to protect the community.

## Contact

If you need to report a serious issue privately, email the repository owner or project contact listed in the repository. If no private contact is available, open an issue and mark it "security" or "private" so maintainers can handle it confidentially.

Thank you for helping keep this project useful, friendly, and constructive.
